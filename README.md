# Windows Application Packaging Project Samples

This repo contains samples to show how to use Visual Studio (2017 15.5 or above, including 2019) to create Windows applications that can take the best of Win32 and UWP worlds in a single package.

# Requirements

You will need to get the latest Visual Studio 2017 version from [here](https://www.visualstudio.com) and the 1803/17134 Windows SDK (it can be installed with the latest Visual Studio tools for UWP).
